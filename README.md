# Simple-Chatbot
Simple rule-based chatbot demo.


A tiny **rule-based chatbot** built entirely in **Python**, designed as a quick project to demonstrate basic programming, logical structuring, and GitHub usage.  

---

## What It Does
- Recognizes a few basic *intents* such as greeting, asking for help, or saying goodbye.  
- Responds with simple pre-defined answers stored in a JSON file.  
- Demonstrates how chatbots work at a fundamental level — through *pattern matching* instead of machine learning.  
- Built to be small, clear, and easy to extend later with NLP or ML features.

## Project Files
| File | Description |
|------|--------------|
| `chatbot.py` | Main Python script that runs the chatbot |
| `intents.json` | Contains the chatbot’s intents, patterns, and responses |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists any required packages (none for now) |
| `.gitignore` | Tells GitHub to ignore unnecessary files like `__pycache__` |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license allowing open-source use |

## How to Run
1. Make sure you have **Python 3.8+** installed.  
2. Download or clone this repository.  
3. Open the project folder in your terminal or command prompt.
